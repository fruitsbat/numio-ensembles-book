# Welcome to NumIO ensembles!

ensembles is a helper for the NumIO benchmarking tool.
It aims to be quick to learn and easy to use as well as well as providing a set of standardized tests.

When running applications on a cluster computing environment there are often other jobs applications running in the background.
ensembles replicates an environment like this using background daemons.
These generate background noise that emulate things like grep or a file download.
